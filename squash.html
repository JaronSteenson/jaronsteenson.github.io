Courts can be accessed by members 24/7.</p><p>Courts may be booked by members at any time using our online booking system.</p></section><section><h2>Club Tournaments</h2><p>We have three major tournaments each year, as well as Club Champs and the Thorndon Doubles. See the latest tournament schedule on Squash NZ calendar.</p><p>If you are wanting to get added to the grading list for competition, please register here on iSquash (please select Thorndon as your club). Once you have done this, please contact our Club Manager who can assist with your membership and grading.</p></section><section><h2>Club Nights</h2><p>Squash club nights are every week on Thursdays 5:30 to 8pm and Sundays 3 to 5pm.</p><h3>Who can come along?</h3><p>Anyone who is a member or considering becoming one. Guests are welcome to come down and try out the facilities if they are thinking of joining the club. There is no fee for using the courts, balls, or rackets for them. We do ask that after their 2nd visit and they wish to continue coming along that they join as a club member.</p><h3>What do I do?</h3><p>Come down to the club from about 5:30pm on Thursdays or 3pm on Sundays, wander into the squash area (follow the outside landing) and let a member know that you are new and here for club night. They’ll show you the ropes and introduce you to fellow members.</p><h3>What do I need?</h3><p>Some gear to do some running around in (squash is energetic) and some non-marking sports shoes. If you’ve got a squash racquet, that is good. If not, the club can lend you one for the night (you’ll need to buy one if you want to join and keep playing though). The club supplies squash balls for club nights.</p><h3>What Else Happens?</h3><p>On Thursday between 6 and 7pm, we rotate people and courts every 10 minutes, a great way to get to play different people at different levels. It’s quite popular, so there’ll be 3 or more people on each court, playing games such as 10AB, King/Queen of the court, three-quarter court, rabbit, and doubles.</p></section><section><h2>Interclub</h2><p>Autumn Interclub starts in March, Winter Interclub in May/June, and Spring Interclub in August/September. If you want to play please contact the club captain to register your interest with the Squash Club Captain.</p><p>If you’re serious about squash or even wanting a little more challenge than the social games you’ve been playing, then Interclub is the competition for you. Interclub is all about being a team player and is a great way to improve your game!</p><h3>What happens?</h3><p>Where possible, you will be placed in a team from 4–6 players of similar graded ability with a team captain. You play once a week on Tuesdays or Wednesdays, 7 pm-11 pm. Games are alternated throughout the Wellington region with five home games and five away games. The home team supplies supper after the games.</p><h3>Who can play?</h3><p>This competition is only open to full club members.</p></section></main><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-8483c0a049109ed2.js" crossorigin="" async=""></script><script>(self.__next_f=self.__next_f||[]).push([0]);self.__next_f.push([2,null])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1:HL[\"/_next/static/media/c9a5bc6a7c948fb0-s.p.woff2\",\"font\",{\"crossOrigin\":\"\",\"type\":\"font/woff2\"}]\n2:HL[\"/_next/static/css/13d8285ceefe7934.css\",\"style\",{\"crossOrigin\":\"\"}]\n0:\"$L3\"\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"4:I[7690,[],\"\"]\n6:I[5613,[],\"\"]\n7:I[1778,[],\"\"]\n8:I[9058,[\"749\",\"static/chunks/749-9b31b24e941be2a5.js\",\"734\",\"static/chunks/734-683e61bed8f71043.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-ec1ead249934c5b6.js\"],\"\"]\na:I[8955,[],\"\"]\nb:[]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"3:[[[\"$\",\"link\",\"0\",{\"rel\":\"stylesheet\",\"href\":\"/_next/static/css/13d8285ceefe7934.css\",\"precedence\":\"next\",\"crossOrigin\":\"\"}]],[\"$\",\"$L4\",null,{\"buildId\":\"7zVnzMLSWdPQ_lsvo0z3r\",\"assetPrefix\":\"\",\"initialCanonicalUrl\":\"/squash\",\"initialTree\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"squash\",{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{}]}]},\"$undefined\",\"$undefined\",true],\"initialSeedData\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"squash\",{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{},[\"$L5\",[[\"$\",\"h1\",null,{\"children\":\"Squash\"}],[\"$\",\"section\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h2\",null,{\"children\":\"Our Facilities\"}],[\"$\",\"p\",null,{\"children\":\"Our facilities include four high-quality squash courts, including a glass back.
